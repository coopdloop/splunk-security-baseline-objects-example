# Splunk Technical Add-on Repository Template

A comprehensive repository template for security engineers to organize, track, and manage Splunk Technical Add-ons (TAs), focusing on data model work, knowledge objects, and security dashboards.

## Multi-Environment Features

This repository supports managing Splunk configurations across multiple environments with inheritance:

### Baseline Template
- Core configurations shared across all environments
- CIM-compliant data models and standard knowledge objects
- Common dashboards and saved searches
- Located in `environments/baseline/`

### Environment-Specific Overrides
- **Development**: Testing configurations with shorter retention
- **Staging**: Production-like settings for validation  
- **Production**: Full compliance and extended retention
- Each environment inherits from baseline and adds customizations

### Management Tools
- **Environment initialization**: `./environment-management/scripts/init-environment.sh`
- **Baseline synchronization**: `./environment-management/scripts/sync-baseline.sh`
- **Deployment automation**: `./environment-management/scripts/deploy.sh`

## Quick Start

### Single Environment Setup
1. **Contributing Data Models**: See [docs/contributing-data-models.md](docs/contributing-data-models.md)
2. **Contributing Knowledge Objects**: See [docs/contributing-knowledge-objects.md](docs/contributing-knowledge-objects.md)
3. **Contributing Dashboards**: See [docs/contributing-dashboards.md](docs/contributing-dashboards.md)

### Multi-Environment Setup
1. **Environment Management**: See [environments/README.md](environments/README.md)
2. **Initialize new environment**: `./environment-management/scripts/init-environment.sh <env-name>`
3. **Deploy to environment**: `./environment-management/scripts/deploy.sh <env-name>`

## Deployment Support

This repository supports both:
- **Splunk Cloud** - See [docs/cloud-deployment.md](docs/cloud-deployment.md)
- **On-Premises** - See [docs/on-premises-deployment.md](docs/on-premises-deployment.md)

## Integration Examples

- External threat intelligence feeds
- Security orchestration platforms
- Vulnerability scanners
- Network security tools

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/splunk-ta-repo.git
   cd splunk-ta-repo
   ```

2. **Choose your focus area**:
   - **Data Models**: Start with [data-models/README.md](data-models/README.md)
   - **Knowledge Objects**: Start with [knowledge-objects/README.md](knowledge-objects/README.md)
   - **Dashboards**: Start with [dashboards/README.md](dashboards/README.md)

3. **Review examples**: Check the [examples/](examples/) directory for sample implementations

4. **Use templates**: Copy templates from [templates/](templates/) for new content
